# My Personal Project

## Student Services Checking Website


Relevant Questions:

- *What will the application do?*

A student can use this application to:
- check in with their fees, 
- deposit money onto their student account, 
- register for courses,
- deregister from classes as well as  
- pay some school and recreational fees.



- *Who can use it?*

My target market right now is the Student market

- *Why is this project of interest to you?*

My initial plan was to work on a course schedule generator,as it is very difficult and time-consuming to register for 
classes at UBC. However, considering how limited the time schedule is
for the project during summer, I decided to go with a much more adequate project considering the circumstances. My 
project is now about a Student online Checking System where the student can register for classes and pay some fees. 
I intend to improve on it (on my personal time) and expand it eventually to a Course Schedule generator software.
